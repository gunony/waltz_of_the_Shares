## What is it?
Analysis of the adjusted closing price of a share and its volume.


## Why using the daily closing price ?
The daily closing price of a share is the price at which the last lot of the shares is bought or sold in the last trading session.
However some outside factors can affect the value of the share price after the market hours. 
The types of adjustments are :
 -  Adjusting Prices for Share Splits : A stock split takes place when a company increases the number of shares in their company. The consequence is an increase of the number of shares and a price decrease of the each shares.
 -  Adjusting for Dividends : Some profit earned by the company are given to the shareholders as dividends. The distribution of part of the profits leads to an outflow of cash and therefore a reduction in the value of the shares. Therefore, the adjusted closing price will take into account the payment of these dividends to the shareholders.
 -  Adjusting for Rights Offerings : A rights issue is the possibility for the existing shareholders to purchase additional new shares in the company at a specific price. This opportuinity will lower the value of existing shares because supply increases have a dilutive effect on the existing shares.
